        <h1 class="title">WEB CODING OVERVIEW</h1>
        	<h1 class="mainhead">Traditional web developers’ coding languages</h1>

        <h2 class="class-title">HTML</h2>
        <p>One of the two basic building blocks of a website; HTML is the actual content of a site, the text, images and the instructions for browsers on how to read this code.</p>
        <h2 class="class-title class-title--css">CSS</h2>
        <p>The other crucial building block of a website; CSS is the styling code for the HTML content.</p>
        <h2 class="class-title class-title--java">Java script</h2>
        <p>JavaScript is code to cause a function to happen in a browser. (e.g. to submit the contents of a form, or perhaps, to cause a modal-window to open and display a slideshow.)</p>
</div>

<div class="col-wrapper">
        <h1 class="mainhead">Web developer’s app tools</h1>

        <h2>Text Editor</h2>
        <p>Where code is written. I use Sublime Text but alternatives, like TextEdit on the Mac, or DreamWeaver are also good but Brad recommends ????? which is very good and free.</p>

        <h2>Command Line</h2>
        <p>Gulp, Node.js, Git and NPM use the Command Line to automate the various tasks ‘commanded’ of them.</p>

        <h2>GitHub</h2>
        <p>GitHub acts like a store, or repository where your projects (‘Repos’) can be safely stored and shared with colleagues and collaborators.</p>

        <p>It also stores useful code that other people have written, and you can download, to make life simpler and more efficient, thereby avoiding the re-invention of the wheel time and again.</p>

        <p>GitHub is just one of many alternative code storage sites available, but is recommended by Brad Schiff.</p>

        <h1 class="mainhead">Web developer’s automation and organisation tools</h1>
        <h2>Git</h2>
        <p>Git helps manage project files.</p>
        <p>Git keeps a record of all changes made by you and any collaborators working on the same project and even at the same time. Those different versions can eventually be merged with each other and with the original master version once everyone is in agreement.</p>

        <p>This project management takes place in conjunction with GitHub (or alternative) and uses Git on the Command Line to ‘push’, ‘pull’, ‘commit’ and ‘merge’ files.</p>

        <h2>Node.js</h2>
        <p>Node.js can turn your computer into a robot assistant performing tasks automatically to save time. It also uses the power of JavaScript codes to run back-end functions.</p>

        <h2>NPM</h2>
        <p>NPM (Node Package Management) is a store from which you can download all sorts of useful code (node-modules, jquery and css files) to make your coding easier and more efficient. This ‘shopping list’ of code is kept in a file called package.json which each website or project will have, as a record of that site’s code ‘ingredients’.</p>

        <h2>Gulp</h2>
        <p>Gulp is a building tool at the heart of all automation. It will be installed globally and locally on your computer. Gulp plug-ins are the building blocks. Gulpfile.js is where the code to implement the automated functions is written.</p>

        <h2>BEM</h2>
        <p>BEM (Block Element Modifier) is a philosophy of how to structure the building process which, along with PostCSS, will help create super organised HTML and css code for all browsers to read.</p>
